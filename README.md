# Online Store Application

This project is an Online Store application with a Flask backend API and an Angular frontend. The initial codebase was semi-generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI language model, with subsequent manual fixes and improvements.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main directories:

- `frontend/`: Angular-based frontend application
- `backend/`: Flask-based backend API

Each directory has its own README with specific setup instructions and details.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with Angular and provides the user interface for the online store. It includes features such as:

- User authentication (login/register)
- Product listing and details
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order placement

For more details, see the [Frontend README](frontend/README.md).

## Backend

The backend is a Flask application that serves as the API for the online store. It includes:

- RESTful API endpoints for products, orders, and authentication
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Redis for token storage
- Docker setup for easy deployment

For more details, see the [Backend README](backend/README.md).

## AI-Assisted Development

The initial codebase for both frontend and backend was semi-generated using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI language model developed by Anthropic. This approach allowed for rapid prototyping and implementation of basic features. However, it's important to note:

1. The generated code served as a starting point and required manual review, testing, and refinement.
2. Specific business logic, security measures, and advanced features were implemented or improved manually.
3. The project structure, naming conventions, and certain architectural decisions were adjusted to better fit best practices and project-specific requirements.

While AI assistance greatly accelerated the initial development process, human oversight and expertise were crucial in producing a production-ready application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow the setup instructions in the README of each subdirectory (frontend and backend)
3. Start both the frontend and backend servers
4. Access the application through the frontend URL (typically `http://localhost:4200`)
